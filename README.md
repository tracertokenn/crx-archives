# crx-archives
Thank you for checking out this project. If anything doesn't work on your old laptop, it's likely because it's a Manifest V3 extension. Don't worry, send me a message on one of my contacts so I can help and possibly downgrade the extension. If I deliberately scout for a Manifest V2 extension version, I will note so. Files that were scouted will be like "your-extension-manifest-v2.crx".


How to use CRX extension? Well, for these files it should just work by installing them. If not, open Chrome. enter chrome://extensions/ in your address bar. Enable developer mode. Click load unpacked. Select extension. If it says "Could not load manifest", RENAME the extension from something like "your-extension.crx" to "your-extension.zip". It's important you renamed and didn't compress. Once done, unzip the file. You can now go back to chrome://extensions/ and load the unpacked folder. Visual tutorial for error on Fedora Linux is in the "IMPORTANT" subfolder.
